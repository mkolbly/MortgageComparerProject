This is a simple application written for purposes of providing an independent Android code 
sample for an online resume. I couldn't use my work from my previous employer 
due to potential copyright infringement. Despite having many years experience 
writing mobile applications in J2ME, PalmOS, Symbian, BREW, Windows Mobile, 
Blackberry and Android, for some reason, some potential employers considered me 
to have a lack of experience due to the fact that I only had a little over a 
year of Android experience and would not even grant me an interview.  Here's a 
memo to those folks - ALL MOBILE PLATFORMS ARE IN A STATE OF CONSTANT CHANGE - 
especially newer ones.  Someone with a proven track record of kicking ass and 
pushing out products to market in multiple startup companies using a variety of 
technologies under severely time-crunched conditions is going to give you more 
bang for the buck than someone with 4-5 years of Android experience and little 
else.  After interviewing a few hundred people myself, I can tell you all from 
experience that an intelligent driven individual will be much more successful 
than simply looking for the perfect skillset match that is mostly outdated every 
six months anyway.
